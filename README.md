# Assignment-3

---

# By: David D. and Ameen S.

This assignment involves designing and implementing a simple 4-bit CPU using a digital simulator. The CPU operates on a basic Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with operations such as moving values between registers, performing arithmetic/logical operations, and handling immediate values.
